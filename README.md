# Overview

This is a simple factorial calculator to learn the basics of the Rust programming language.

The program has a factorial calculator in a structure to get experience with structures and recursion in Rust. Having it in a function is better, however, it allowed practice with structures and implementations.

# Future Work

A list of items to change or improve in the future.

- Have the method calculate the factorial without changing the field value.
- Add more than just factorial capabilities.
